            <h1 class="">I really like the hypermedia systems book</h1>
            <p>
                Maybe it was because I was actually deeply interested in htmx, or maybe- who am I kidding? It's mostly because I really wanted to learn htmx and a lot of youtubers I like were talking about it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Am I biased? Yes, without a shadow of a doubt, don't care though.
            </p>
            <h2>I should have started with the book</h2>
            <p>
                You see, I learned web dev specifically to learn htmx, before that I had very little coding experience (mostly consisting of small video games). And because of that, I also had to learn html, css, web frameworks.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was a pain in the ass. But one thing that helped me actually get started making things was actually the first part of the book. It was a clean outline of the tools used, the plan for using them, and how it was used to implement the plan. Before that, all I did were tutorial/template projects where I was taught what a thing did, and while I think those were important and if I didn't go through them I would have had a harder time understanding the book, they didn't teach me how to make.
            </p>
            <p>
                The book taught me the thought process of actually making stuff that I could apply to anything else and it just clicked with me in a way that I don't think any tutorial has so far.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides that, the early portions of the book also gave me a bit more context just as a side benefit. PGR, what a header is, those ?'s in urls, semantic importance of html tags. Tips tricks and things that I didn't know existed explained and more importantly showed in a way that I could understand.
            </p>
            <p>
                And while this is a sample size of 1, I honestly believe that the book is a great place to maybe not start, but at least use as a jumping off point for creating something yourself.
            </p>

            <h2>I didn't need convincing</h2>
            <p>
                One thing I noted when reading the book was how much work it put into convincing me to take a look at hypermedia. To evaluate it as a tool that can be used in the modern day.
            </p>
            <p>
                My brother in christ, I didn't even know what an SPA was.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right now, all I know is static sites and htmx sites. I quite literally don't know how to build with anything else. I don't understand why anyone would send json instead of html, that seems like a pain in the ass. Like, that's literally just templating with extra steps. And if you send json you lose the power of representation the browser already has. And making changes means you also ha-
            </p>
            <p>
                Is this why the book spent that much time convincing me earlier?
            </p>
            <h2>An emphasis on pragmatism with a dash of ideals</h2>
            <p>
                The book in many points emphasize pragmatism over <em>perfection</em>. To look at technologies as tools to be evaluated as solutions to problems. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                Basically it means that I shouldn't hate json as much as I do. Too bad I'm selectively illiterate so I'll just keep hating json.
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                But the book also tells me to do my best. To solve problems within the constraints of html, to actually read its spec (didn't even know what existed), to follow practices that will hopefully maximize the gains I can get from using a hypermedia system.
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel that the book set me up for future success and at this point it's become a landmark on my programming journey. It helps that I'm still fairly new to programming, but the knowledge I gained here <em>feel</em> like they're going to be useful to me for a while.
            </p>
            <p>
                I could just be wrong, but I like being optimistic so I'll ignore that possibility. Are there any other books out there that have this combination of casual-ish tone and approachability. Cause I'm reading Computer Systems by Ata Elahi for school and holy shit is that book not a pleasant read.
            </p>
            <p>
                I mean the book does the job, but by god is it dry. Also the hypermedia book is great. Thats it.
